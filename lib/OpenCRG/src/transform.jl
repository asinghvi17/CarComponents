    integrate_reference_line(refline, phi) -> (x, y)

Integrate heading `phi` (`phi[i]` = heading of the segment ARRIVING at node
`i`; `phi[1]` is unused as an arrival heading — it's `REFERENCE_LINE_START_PHI`,
already substituted in by `assemble_channels`) into world-frame positions,
replicating `calcRefLine` in the reference implementation's `crgLoader.c`:

- No end position given (`refline.end_x === nothing` AND `refline.end_y ===
  nothing`): simple forward Euler, `x[i+1] = x[i] + du*cos(phi[i+1])`.
- Both `end_x`/`end_y` given: integrate backward from the true end point
  using the same arrival-phi convention, then blend the forward-continuation
  value with the backward-derived value linearly across the whole line
  (fraction 0 at the start, 1 at the end) — redistributing integration error
  instead of leaving it all as a discontinuity at the very end.
- Exactly one of `end_x`/`end_y` given: an error, not a silent fallback to
  Case A -- you can't sensibly blend only one of two coordinates, and a real
  file with only one of the pair set is far more likely to indicate a
  parsing bug or corruption than genuine spec-compliant data (the ASAM
  example files always declare both or neither).

`nu == 1` degenerates safely in both cases: the loop ranges become empty
(`1:0`), so only the start point is ever produced, and `end_x`/`end_y` are
never read.

    integrate_reference_z(refline, slope, nu) -> z_ref

1D analogue of `integrate_reference_line`, integrating longitudinal `slope`
(dz/du) into a reference-line elevation profile. If there's no `slope`
channel at all, `refline.start_slope` (default 0.0, from
`REFERENCE_LINE_START_S`) is used as a constant slope for every step. If
there's no slope channel AND `start_slope == 0.0`, the reference
implementation (`calcRefLineZ`) skips this early — we represent that as a
constant-zero vector, since `z`-grid values are always added on top
downstream regardless (see `assemble_z_grid`).
